# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Instructions

- @agent/prompts/i-am-max.md

## Overview

Rulesets is a CommonMark-compliant rules compiler that lets you author a single source rules file in Markdown and compile it into provider-specific rules files (`.cursor/rules.mdc`, `./CLAUDE.md`, `.roo/rules.md`, and more). Think of it as Terraform for AI rules: write once, compile for many providers, your agents, no matter the tool, on the (literal) same page.

## Critical Instructions

✅ Always follow the language spec @docs/project/LANGUAGE.md
✅ Always ensure the `.gitignore` file is updated to exclude potentially sensitive information  
✅ Always work from a feature branch off of `main` or a `fix/` branch off of a target feature branch
✅ Commit regularly, group commits logically, and use conventional commit messages. When committing, always check to see if there are unstaged changes.
✅ When writing code, follow the SOLID principles, DRY principles, KISS principle, and include descriptive inline comments for future developers
❌ Never automatically create a PR for a feature branch without explicit user direction
✅ When creating PRs follow the instructions in `.claude/commands/create-pr.md`

## Key Concepts

### Source rules

- Source files defining rules, written in 100% previewable Markdown.
- Use `.rule.md` extension (preferred) or `.md` extension.
- Written in Ruleset syntax and use `{{...}}` notation markers to direct the compiler.
- Compiled into provider-specific rules files:
  - `./ruleset/src/my-rule.rule.md` → `.cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc`

### Provider

- A supported tool, such as cursor, windsurf, or claude-code.
- Defines tool-specific criteria for compiling source rules to compiled rules files.
- Provided through plugins.

### Compiled rules

- Provider-specific (tool) rules files, rendered from the source rules.
- Examples for a source rules file called `project-conventions.md`:
  - Cursor → `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc`
  - Claude Code → `./CLAUDE.md#project-conventions`
  - OpenAI Codex → `./conventions.md`.
- When placed in tool directories, referred to as "tool-ready rules".

### Notation Marker

- Syntax: `{{...}}`
- Fundamental building block of Ruleset syntax
- Used to direct the compiler for various purposes (blocks, imports, variables)
- All Ruleset directives use marker notation, but serve different functions
- Similar to `<xml-tags>`, but fully Markdown-previewable.

### Block

- Syntax: `{{block-name}}...{{/block-name}}`
- A specific application of notation markers that creates delimited content blocks
- Translates directly to XML tags in compiled output: `<block_name>...</block_name>`
- Has opening and closing notation markers that surround content
- Can contain properties that control rendering behavior
- Example: `{{instructions}}This is instruction content{{/instructions}}`

### Import

- Syntax: `{{> my-rule }}`
- Embed content from another source rules file, block, partial, or template.

### Variable

- Syntax: `{{$key}}` or `$key` if used within a `{{...}}` marker.
- Dynamic values replaced inline at compile time.
- Examples: `{{$provider}}`, `{{$.frontmatter.key}}`, `{{$alias}}`

## Goals

| Goal                  | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✨ **Simplicity**     | Reduce bespoke format/structure for each tool to just one.          |
| 🧹 **Lintability**    | Files must pass standard markdown-lint without hacks.               |
| 👀 **Previewability** | Render legibly in GitHub, VS Code, Obsidian, etc.                   |
| 🧩 **Extensibility**  | Advanced behaviors declared via attributes instead of new notation. |

## Providers

| ID            | Tool               | Type              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `cursor`      | Cursor             | IDE               |
| `windsurf`    | Windsurf           | IDE               |
| `claude-code` | Claude Code        | CLI               |
| `roo-code`    | Roo Code           | VS Code Extension |
| `cline`       | Cline              | VS Code Extension |
| `openai-codex` | OpenAI Codex      | CLI/Web agent     |
