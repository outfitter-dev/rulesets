## Quick Reference

### Most Common Commands

```bash
# Development
bun install               # Install dependencies
bunx turbo run dev        # Start dev mode
bunx turbo run build      # Build all packages
bunx turbo run test       # Run all tests

# Code Quality
bun run lint            # Run linter
bun run format          # Format code
bun run typecheck       # Check types

# Rules Compilation
bun run compile         # Compile all rules
bun run compile --watch # Watch mode

# Git
git checkout -b feature/name            # New feature branch (compatible everywhere)
# or
git switch -c feature/name              # Modern alternative
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: description"  # Commit
git push -u origin HEAD          # Push current branch
gh pr create -f -B main          # Create PR against main

# Quick Checks
bun run ci:local        # Full CI check locally

## Workflow Categories

- **Daily Development**: build, test, lint, development
- **Feature Work**: feature-implementation, provider-plugin
- **Bug Fixes**: bug-fix, debugging, troubleshooting
- **Releases**: release, documentation
- **Maintenance**: setup, ci-cd
- **Collaboration**: git, pull-request

## Tips

1. Always work from a feature branch off `main`
2. Run `bun run ci:local` before creating PRs
3. Use conventional commit messages
4. Keep PRs focused on single features/fixes
5. Update tests and documentation with code changes
6. Tag `@coderabbitai` in PR comments for automated review
