# Proposed Fixes and Enhancements for spec/overview.md (v0.x)

This document outlines proposed changes and clarifications for `spec/overview.md` based on recent discussions. The goal is to improve clarity, add missing details, and identify areas for further refinement.

## 1. Option Processing Order

**Observation:** The `spec/overview.md` document does not explicitly state the processing order of options, which is crucial for understanding how combined or potentially conflicting options are resolved.

**Proposal:** Add a note about the left-to-right processing order of options, especially for inclusion/exclusion modifiers and target-scoped options.

**Suggested Location:** Potentially within the "Track Marker Parsing" section or as a new sub-section under "Tracks".

+#### Option Processing Order
+
+Options within a track marker are processed sequentially from left to right. This processing order affects three main categories of options:
+
+1. **Basic Options**: Simple formatting options like `tag-omit` or `code-js`
+2. **Target Inclusion/Exclusion**: Modifiers like `+target` and `!target`
+3. **Target-Scoped Options**: Special formatting for specific targets using `target:[options]`
+
+The evaluation follows this simple rule:
+
+- Options are applied **in the exact order they appear** (left to right)
+- When conflict occurs, **the last directive wins**
+
+**Simple Example:**
+```markdown
+{{track code-js tag-omit}}
+```
+First applies `code-js` (JavaScript code block formatting), then applies `tag-omit` (removes surrounding XML tags).
+
+**Practical Target Example:**
+```markdown
+{{track +ide !windsurf cursor:[tag-omit]}}
+```
+This would:
+1. Include the track for all IDE targets (`+ide`)
+2. Exclude it specifically for Windsurf (`!windsurf`), even though Windsurf might be in the IDE group
+3. Apply the `tag-omit` option, but only when building for Cursor
+
+**Conflict Resolution Example:**
+```markdown
+{{track h-2 h-3}}
+```
+The track would use heading level 3 because `h-3` appears last and overrides `h-2`.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> While options are processed left-to-right, certain option types like `name()` might have special handling if specified multiple times. When in doubt about complex combinations, the last specified option for a particular feature usually takes precedence.
+

## 2. Enhanced Target Scoping Examples

**Observation:** While `spec/overview.md` introduces target-scoped options, it lacks explicit examples for combined patterns involving inclusion/exclusion with these scoped options, as well as group scoping.

**Proposal:** Add a more comprehensive set of examples to the "Target-scoped Option Overrides" and "Target-scoped Multiple Options" sections, or a dedicated sub-section.

**Suggested Location:** Enhance existing sections or add a new sub-section under "Tracks".

**Proposed Examples:**

````markdown
**Comprehensive Target Scoping Examples:**

- **Target-specific option (block included for all targets unless otherwise specified):**
  `{{instructions cursor:name(cursor-specific-rules)}}`
  *(Applies `name(cursor-specific-rules)` only for the `cursor` target. The block itself is included for all targets by default.)*

- **Target-specific multiple options (block included for all targets):**
  `{{instructions cursor:[name(cursor-rules) code-js]}}`
  *(Applies `name(cursor-rules)` and `code-js` only for the `cursor` target.)*

- **Inclusion for a target with a specific option:**
  `{{instructions +cursor:name(only-for-cursor)}}`
  *(Includes this track *only* for the `cursor` target, and for `cursor`, it uses `name(only-for-cursor)`.)*

- **Inclusion for a target with multiple specific options:**
  `{{instructions +cursor:[name(cursor-rules) code-js]}}`
  *(Includes this track *only* for the `cursor` target, applying both `name(cursor-rules)` and `code-js` for `cursor`.)*

- **Exclusion for a target, even if a scoped option is present:**
  `{{instructions !cursor:name(ignored-for-cursor)}}`
  *(Excludes this track for the `cursor` target. The `name(ignored-for-cursor)` option would not apply as the track is excluded for `cursor`.)*
  
- **Exclusion for a target with multiple specific options (options are moot due to exclusion):**
  `{{instructions !cursor:[name(cursor-rules) code-js]}}`
  *(Excludes this track for the `cursor` target.)*

- **Group inclusion with member exclusion and scoped options for the group:**
  `{{instructions +ide:[code-block] !cursor}}`
  *(Includes this track for all targets in the `ide` group, applying the `code-block` option, but explicitly excludes it for the `cursor` target, even if `cursor` is part of the `ide` group. Assumes `ide` is a defined group.)*

 This applies both `name(cursor-rules)` and `code-js` options only when building for the cursor target, without affecting other targets. The square brackets group the options that are scoped to that specific target.

## 3. Whitespace Handling in Option Groups

**Observation:** The current "Option Bracketing Rules" section or general "Whitespace Handling" doesn't explicitly detail whitespace *within* the `[]` of option groups.

**Proposal:** Clarify that leading and trailing whitespace within the square brackets `[]` of an option group is optional and ignored by the parser, similar to whitespace around `{{` and `}}`.

**Suggested Location:** Add to the "Option Bracketing Rules" section.

+Leading and trailing whitespace within the option group brackets `[]` is optional and will be ignored by the parser. Spaces between options within the brackets are necessary delimiters. For example, `[ option1  option2 ]` is equivalent to `[option1 option2]`.

## 4. Consolidated Option Grouping Quick Reference

**Observation:** While option grouping and target scoping are explained, a consolidated quick reference of common patterns could improve usability.

**Proposal:** Add a small table or list showcasing common invocation patterns for option grouping, especially with target scoping.

## 5. Further Improvements and Clarifications

This section covers areas that could benefit from minor clarifications or points to consider for future consistency and ease of use.

### 5.1. Potential Confusion: `target:[options]` vs. `+target:[options]`

**Observation:** The distinction between `{{track target:[option-a option-b]}}` and `{{track +target:[option-a option-b]}}` is subtle but critical.
    - `target:[options]` applies options *if* the block is being rendered for that target (i.e., the block is included by default or via another rule). It does *not* cause the block to be included solely for that target.
    - `+target:[options]` explicitly includes the block *only* for that target and applies the specified options.

**Proposal:** Ensure this distinction is very clearly articulated, perhaps with a dedicated note or more explicit phrasing in the relevant examples. The "Further Target Scoping Examples" (added in item #2 above) aims to clarify this through examples. An additional explicit note could be beneficial.

**Suggested Text (example for a note):**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Differentiating Scoped Options from Scoped Inclusion:
> - `target:[my-option]` means "If this track is rendered for `target`, apply `my-option`." The track's general inclusion is determined elsewhere (e.g. by default, or by a `+target` on its own).
> - `+target:[my-option]` means "Render this track *only* for `target`, and when doing so, apply `my-option`." This controls both inclusion and target-specific options simultaneously.

### 5.2. Clarity: Custom XML Attributes `key="value"` vs. Structured Option `name(value)`

**Observation:**
- `spec/overview.md` (line 283) correctly lists `name(value)` as setting a name and "Custom `key="value"`" for passthrough attributes.
- The description for `name(value)` in the "Track Options" table is "Sets a name with a specified value for the track."
- The "Multi-line Markers for Readability" section (line 264) states: "Note: Using the `name(value)` syntax tells Mixdown to include this attribute in the rendered output". This is true, but *any* `key="value"` custom attribute is also included in the rendered output if not `tag-omit`.
- The key distinction is that `name(some-name)` specifically sets the XML `name` attribute (e.g. `<instructions name="some-name">`), which might have special meaning for Mixdown or certain targets. Other `key="value"` pairs are generic passthrough attributes.

**Proposal:** Slightly rephrase the note on line 264-265 to emphasize that `name(value)` sets a *specific* XML attribute named `name`, distinct from general custom attributes.

### 5.3. Simplification Review: `code` vs. `code-auto`

**Observation:** `options-proposal.md` (line 200, "Code Block Options" table) listed `code-auto` for "Auto-detect language". `spec/overview.md` (Comprehensive Option Reference Table, line 868) uses `code` for "Auto-detect code language".

**Confirmation:** The use of `code` in `spec/overview.md` is a good simplification and seems to be the intended final syntax. This is more of a confirmation that the spec reflects the desired state. No change needed if `code` is the final decision.

### 5.4. Enhanced Clarity on `{{link ...}}` Preview Limitations

**Observation:** `spec/overview.md` (line 512, note) states: "Standard Markdown links will work in previews as expected within the `.mixdown/mixes` directory, but `{{link ...}}` will not."

**Proposal:** Briefly add *why* `{{link ...}}` doesn't work in standard previews to manage user expectations.

**Suggested Addition to the Note (line 513):**
> ...but `{{link ...}}` will not, as it requires compilation by Mixdown to resolve paths relative to the final output directory and apply any target-specific link transformations.

### 5.5. Variable Scope and Potential Namespace Clarity

**Observation:** Variables `{{$key}}` (alias), `{{$.key}}` (frontmatter), and `{{$target}}`/`{{$target.id}}` (system) are generally clear.
    - The `.` in `{{$.key}}` effectively namespaces frontmatter variables away from aliases.
    - System variables like `$target` are distinct.

**Consideration (Minor):** Is there any scenario where an alias could be named, for example, `target` (i.e., `{{$target}}`) and clash with the system variable `{{$target}}`? Or does the system variable always take precedence / have a protected namespace?
This is likely handled by a defined order of precedence (e.g., system > frontmatter > alias, or specific parsing rules).

**Proposal:** If not already implicitly covered by parser design, a brief note on variable resolution order or namespace protection in the "Variables" section could be useful for advanced users, though likely not critical for a general overview. For now, this is more of a thought-point for internal consistency checks rather than a specific doc change unless major ambiguity is perceived.

### 5.6. Target Group Definition Source

**Observation:** The proposal and examples (e.g., `+ide:[code-block] !cursor`) use the concept of "target groups" (like `ide`). The `spec/overview.md` document doesn't explicitly state *where* these groups are defined (presumably in `mixdown.config.json`).

**Proposal:** Add a brief parenthetical note when target groups are first exemplified, indicating their typical definition source.

**Suggested Location:** In the "Further Target Scoping Examples" added in item #2, or the "Comprehensive Option Reference Table".

**Example text already incorporated into item #2's diff:** `(Assumes ide is a defined group, typically in mixdown.config.json.)`
This seems sufficient for an overview document.

This document should serve as a good basis for refining `spec/overview.md`.
