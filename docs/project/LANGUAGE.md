| **Block**                 | Delimited blocks marked with `{{block}}...{{/block}}`                                | "Define a block for agent instructions."                                                         |
| **Block Content**         | The content between opening and closing block markers                                | "The block content contains the actual instructions for the AI assistant."                       |
| **Block Name**            | The kebab-case or snake_case identifier after the opening `{{`                       | "Use a descriptive block name like {{user-instructions}}."                                       |
| **Import**                | A reference to another source rules file or block                                    | "Import common guidelines into multiple files."                                                  |
| **Import Scope**          | Selective filtering of blocks during import                                          | "Use import scope with `{{> my-rules#(my-block) }}` to import specific blocks."                  |

| **System Variable**       | Built-in variables provided by the compiler                                          | "The `$destination` system variable contains the current destination ID."                        |
| **Variable Substitution** | The process of replacing variables with their values                                 | "Variable substitution happens automatically during compilation."                                |

| **Scope**                 | A destination-specific context for properties                                        | "Use destination:property to apply properties in a specific scope."                              |
| **Scoped Value**          | A property value that applies only to specific destinations                          | "The destination:code-javascript is a destination-scoped value."                                 |
| **Property Family**       | The prefix part before the hyphen in properties (e.g., `code-` in `code-javascript`) | "The code- family includes language-specific formatting properties."                             |
| **Property Value**        | Value enclosed in parentheses after a property family                                | "The code-javascript defines JavaScript-specific formatting."                                    |

## Linguistic Conventions

### General Principles

- Prefer clear, specific terminology over vague descriptions
- Be consistent with capitalization and hyphenation
- Use declarative present tense when describing functionality

### Specific Terminology Patterns

#### Compilation Process

- ✅ "Compile source rules into compiled rules"
- ✅ "Generate destination-specific rules files"
- ✅ "Transform source rules into compiled rules"
- ❌ "Render artifacts" (outdated)

#### Compilation Results

- ✅ "Compiled rules" (as a noun for the compilation result)
- ✅ "Compiled rules are written to their respective locations"
- ✅ "The source rules file is compiled into rules for each destination"
- ✅ "Compilation artifacts" (for referring to files generated during compilation)
- ❌ "The rendered artifact" (outdated)

#### Compilation Logical Flow

- ✅ "Source rules → compilation → compilation artifacts → compiled rules" (for describing the complete process)
- ✅ "Source rules → compilation → compiled rules" (simplified version)

#### Content Display

- ✅ "Formatted as" (when describing how content appears)
- ✅ "Displayed as" (for visual presentation)
- ✅ "Converted to" (for transformation descriptions)
- ❌ "Rendered as" (avoid when possible)

#### Properties Terminology

- ✅ "Apply properties to" (when adding configuration to blocks)
- ✅ "Scope properties to" (when applying properties to specific destinations)
- ✅ "Include with `+`" (when referring to inclusion)
- ✅ "Exclude with `!`" (when referring to exclusion)
- ✅ "Property family" (for the prefix part of properties, like `code-` or `h-`)
- ✅ "Property group" (for collections of related properties serving a common purpose)
- ✅ "Property pattern" (for consistent naming conventions like `prefix-*`)
- ✅ "Destination-scoped properties" (for properties applied to specific destinations)
- ✅ "Property value" (for values in parentheses like `name-("destination-rules")`)
- ❌ "Property settings" (use "property values" instead)
- ❌ "Destination-specific properties" (use "destination-scoped properties" instead)
- ❌ "Attribute" (use "property" for Ruleset directives, "XML attribute" for compiled rules)

#### XML Generation

- ✅ "Converted to XML tags"
- ✅ "Translated to XML"
- ✅ "Compiled as XML notation"
- ✅ "Rulesets compiles rules into pure Markdown, XML, or a combination of the two"
- ❌ "Renders as XML" (outdated)
- ❌ "Outputs XML notation" (outdated)
- ❌ "The compiler generates XML" (myopic, as XML is just one potential output format)

## File and Directory Structure

| Entity Type                | Naming Convention        | Example                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Source Rules files         | `kebab-case.ruleset.md`  | `coding-standards.ruleset.md` |
| Directory                  | `kebab-case`             | `_partials`                   |
| Config files               | `kebab-case.config.json` | `ruleset.config.json`         |
| Block markers              | `kebab-case`             | `{{user-instructions}}`       |
| XML Tags in compiled rules | `snake_case`             | `<user_instructions>`         |

### Distribution Directory Structure

The `.ruleset/dist/` directory stores compiled rules, compilation artifacts, and related data:

| Path                                      | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ruleset/dist/latest/`                   | Symlink to the latest compilation                          |
| `.ruleset/dist/runs/`                     | Directory for all compilations and their artifacts         |
| `.ruleset/dist/runs/run-<timestamp>/`     | Directory containing specific compiled rules and artifacts |
| `.ruleset/dist/runs/run-<timestamp>.json` | Compilation metadata for each run                          |
| `.ruleset/dist/logs/`                     | Log files for all compilations                             |
| `.ruleset/dist/logs/run-<timestamp>.log`  | Compilation log for each run                               |

### Destination Directories

"Destination Directory" refers to a specific rules directory for a particular destination. For example:

- `.cursor/rules` is a destination directory for Cursor
- `.claude/commands` is a destination directory for Claude Code slash commands
- `CLAUDE.md` has no specific destination directory as it's placed at the project root

## Delimiter Usage

Rulesets uses specific delimiters consistently throughout the syntax:

| Delimiter | Role                     | Example                               | Purpose                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:`       | Scope indicator          | `destination:code-javascript`         | Indicates that properties are scoped to a specific destination |
| `()`      | Property value container | `name-("destination-rules")`          | Contains value for a property family                           |
| `[]`      | Property grouping        | `destination:[property-1 property-2]` | Groups multiple properties for readability                     |
| `+`       | Inclusion modifier       | `+destination`                        | Indicates inclusion of a destination                           |
| `!`       | Exclusion modifier       | `!destination`, `!block-two`          | Indicates exclusion of a destination or block on imports       |
| `""`      | XML attribute value      | `priority="high"`                     | Contains custom XML attribute values                           |

## Markdown Formatting

- Headings (`#` notation)
  - Must be preceded and followed by blank lines
  - Must not end with `:`
- Code blocks
  - Use triple backticks to wrap, unless there is another code block nested, in which case increment the backticks by 1
  - Must include language identifier (fall back to `text` if no language is appropriate)
  - Must be preceded and followed by blank lines
  - Use the indentation level of the preceding content to determine the level of the code block
- Use bullet lists for collections of related items
  - Use two spaces for indentation
  - Lists must be preceded and followed by blank lines
  - Never add blank lines in between list items
  - Use sublist items for additional details
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
  - When adding list items within a numbered list, use three spaces for the indentation start
- Prefer tables for structured data comparison
- Use GitHub-style admonitions for additional information. `> [!TIP|INFO|WARNING|CAUTION|DANGER]\n>Helpful information`

## Terminology Best Practices

- Be consistent with terminology across all documentation and code
- When new terms are introduced, add them to this language spec
- Prefer clarity over cleverness in technical documentation
- Use examples liberally to illustrate abstract concepts
- Avoid using previous terminology (mix, track, snippet, target, output, etc.)
